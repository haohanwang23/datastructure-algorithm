1. Problem is defined by a set of possible inputs (set)
2. Relationship between inputs and outputs 

* Solution: 
  + Input --> Procedure --> Output

## What are the inputs?
* Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age in days

  + Input: 2 dates 
    + Second data must not be before first date --> **Defensive Programming**
    
  + How are inputs represented
